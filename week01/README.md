# Assignment - Week 01

1. If you haven't done it yet, install Bioconductor

2. Install the packages we'll need (see the [install.R file](install.R))

3. Create a R markdown in which you:
  * load the epiwraps library (using `library(epiwraps)` )
  * print the session info (using `sessionInfo()` )

4. Render your markdown, and push both the `.Rmd` and `.html` files to your github repo.
